# Character-Sheet
This is a character creation program where we apply numerical values to different attributes 
(Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) then apply them to contextual modifiers. This program is heavily
inspired Dungeons and Dragons and while it can be used in Tabletop Roleplaying Games (TTRPG), but the program extends beyond gaming. 
The program can be used to model agents in simulations, tracking development, or evalute configurable systems where attributes follow
rules and modifiers. This program is not used to represent real individuals, only entities.  

This is currently a work-in-progress.
